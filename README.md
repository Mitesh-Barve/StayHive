## Overview  
StayHive is a full-stack property and vacation-rental platform that bridges the gap between guests seeking accommodations and hosts looking to list their properties.

The platform features a modern and responsive UI with support for light/dark mode toggling, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices. It also integrates secure user authentication, allowing for protected access to personalized dashboards and booking histories.  

Beyond core booking functionalities, StayHive emphasizes usability and trust with planned features like reviews and ratings, payment gateway integration, and admin oversight for managing listings and user activities. With scalability in mind, StayHive aims to provide a comprehensive, reliable, and user-friendly solution for the property rental ecosystem.
